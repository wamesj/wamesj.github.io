        <p style="color:red;">The Cultural Revolution, which started from 1955 to 1976, 
            opened up a chaotic history in modern China. Chairmen Mao, 
            who believed the current Communist leaders were destroying 
            the party, accused the party and its leaders, like Liushaoqi 
            and Dingxiaoping, of having elitism, capitalist tendencies, 
            inefficiency, bureaucratism, and loss of revolutionary fervor. 
            He then called on the nation's young people to exterminate 
            Chinese society's corrupted system. Mao wanted to restore 
            the revolutionary spirit that had led to triumph in the 
            civil war against the Kuomintang 20 years earlier. </p>
        <p style="color:red;">The Red Guards, organized with millions of teenagers, 
            believed in Mao's words: "Bombard the headquarters!" 
            These young people broke into factories, government officials, 
            and schools to beat managers, governors, and teachers. Quoting 
            from Mao: "Destroy toxic weeds!", the Red guards humiliated 
            capitalists and intellectuals publicly and sent them to 
            countrysides for reeducation. The Red Guards also attacked 
            libraries and museums, destroying many valuable books and 
            cultural relics. Factories shut down led to the decline of 
            production; school closed because students were busy 
            "destroying the four olds"——the old philosophy, the old culture, 
            the old custom, and the old habit. Mountains of paintings, literature, 
            music, plays were burned and banned from viewing. This turned into an
             anti-cultural revolution.
