        <h1>Reforms in Education: failure paved with good intentions</h1>
        <p>The Cultural Revolution, which started from 1955 to 1976, 
            opened up a chaotic history in modern China. Chairmen Mao, 
            who believed the current Communist leaders were destroying 
            the party, accused the party and its leaders, like Liushaoqi 
            and Dingxiaoping, of having elitism, capitalist tendencies, 
            inefficiency, bureaucratism, and loss of revolutionary fervor. 
            He then called on the nation's young people to exterminate 
            Chinese society's corrupted system. Mao wanted to restore 
            the revolutionary spirit that had led to triumph in the 
            civil war against the Kuomintang 20 years earlier. </p>
